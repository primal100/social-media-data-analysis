Last Updated: January 17, 2026

1. Acceptance of Terms
By authorizing the Permanent Motion application ("the App") via TikTok, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

2. Description of Service
The App is a data-processing tool that interfaces with the TikTok Display API to fetch video metadata (captions, counts, and timestamps) for the purpose of generating AI-compatible datasets.

3. User Obligations
Account Ownership: You must be the owner of the TikTok account you are authorizing.

Compliance: You agree to follow TikTok’s Community Guidelines and Developer Terms of Service while using this tool.

4. Data Usage & Intellectual Property
Ownership: You retain all rights to your original TikTok content. We only claim ownership over the specific code and logic used to format the data.

AI Processing: You acknowledge that the data generated is intended for use in third-party Generative AI tools and that you are responsible for how you use that data within those platforms.

5. Limitation of Liability
The App is provided "as is" without any warranties. As we are based in Ireland, these terms are governed by the laws of Ireland. We are not liable for any account restrictions or data loss resulting from the use of the TikTok API.

6. Modifications to Service
We reserve the right to expand this tool for other users or transition it to a commercial service in the future. Any significant changes to how your data is handled will be reflected in an updated Privacy Policy.
